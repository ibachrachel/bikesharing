## Overview

*Background*

On trips to large cities and landmarks, a great way to see the sights and interact with the people is to use a bike to get around. CitiBike in New York is extremely popular and a couple of entrepreneurs would like to analyze why it is so success in New York. They intend to implent a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa and must be able to understand the components. This will help them institute a successful program in their home city. 

*Purpose*

Funding the program will be the next step in setting up the bike share, so it's important to create a convincing argument to pitch. To convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, a bike trip analysis will be shown to  the key stakeholders. From the CitiBike Data, the "tripduration" column will need to be changed from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, visualizations will be created to show the following: 

- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
